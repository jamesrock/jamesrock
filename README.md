## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James â€” a Senior Front-End Developer currently based in Nottingham, open to London-based remote roles.

My full CV is available over at [jamesrock.me](jamesrock.me). 

### Background

Over the last 15 years I've built and contributed to many exciting projects, working with well-known brands such as BMW, MINI, GSK, Sky Sports, Heineken, Post Office, Ben & Jerry's and London Fashion Week to name just a few. Iâ€™ve built everything from static micro sites using raw HTML/CSS/JS right through to fully-fledged API-driven web apps using React, Next and Nuxt. Besides coding, Iâ€™ve a passion for usability and would also consider myself a UX designer. 

Two examples of commercial work that are both publicly available and not subject to NDA would be [incolchester.co.uk](https://incolchester.co.uk) and [visitclaphamjunction.com](https://visitclaphamjunction.com) â€” both based on CraftCMS.

### Personal Endeavours

I recently built the same app using [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), [Angular](https://angular.dev), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Solid](https://docs.solidjs.com) â€” all but one of which I'd never used before â€” in less than 10 days. 

All five repos are available here on GitHub:

[github.com/svelte-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/svelte-movies)  
[github.com/nuxt-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nuxt-movies)  
[github.com/next-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nextjs-movies)  
[github.com/solid-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/solid-movies)  
[github.com/angular-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/angular-movies)  

### Game Dev

[Frappy Bird](https://frappybird.com) â€” a remake of the classic tap-to-flap game Flappy Bird that's no longer available on the AppStore, written using Phaser JS. Repo also available at [phaser-frappybird](https://github.com/jamesrock/phaser-frappybird). I've also built several other web-based games, most of which are available on the AppStore (with thanks to [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com)) â€” examples include [Rodoku](https://github.com/jamesrock/capacitor-rodoku), [Thirteens](https://github.com/jamesrock/capacitor-thirteens) and [Hexblox](https://github.com/jamesrock/capacitor-hexblox).
