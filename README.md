## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James â€” a Senior Front-End Developer with over 15 years experience under my belt. 

Currently based in Nottingham, I'm ideally looking for remote London-based roles â€” my intention is to be back down that way working on-site 5 days a week before too long.

My full CV is available over at [jamesrock.me](jamesrock.me). 

### Background

I'm across the full front-end spectrum, including UX design, having built and contributed to many wonderful projects over the years. As is typical, most of my work is either under NDA, has been taken down for one reason or another, or has been completely bastardised since I moved on. That's just the fleeting nature of contracting, unfortunately. It's all rather throwaway â€” I'd much rather be involved in more meaningful projects over the long-term.

### Latest Project

I recently built the same app using [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), [Angular](https://angular.dev), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Solid](https://docs.solidjs.com) â€” all but one of which I'd never used before â€” in less than 10 days. 

All five repos can be found here on GitHub:

[github.com/svelte-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/svelte-movies)  
[github.com/nuxt-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nuxt-movies)  
[github.com/next-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nextjs-movies)  
[github.com/solid-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/solid-movies)  
[github.com/angular-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/angular-movies)  

### Older Projects

I'm rather fond of my Flappy Bird remake â€” the classic tap-to-flap game no longer available on the AppStore â€” go check it out over at [frappybird.com](https://frappybird.com). You can find the repo at [github.com/phaser-frappybird](https://github.com/jamesrock/phaser-frappybird).
