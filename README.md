## Hi there 👋

I'm James — a Senior Front-End Developer currently based in Nottingham, open to London-based remote roles.

My full CV is available over at [jamesrock.me](jamesrock.me). 

### Background

Over the last 15 years I've built and contributed to many exciting projects, working with well-known brands such as BMW, MINI, GSK, Sky Sports, Heineken, Post Office, Ben & Jerry's and London Fashion Week to name just a few. I’ve built everything from static micro sites using raw HTML/CSS/JS right through to fully-fledged API-driven web apps using React, Next and Nuxt. Besides coding, I’ve a passion for usability, and consider myself a UX designer at heart. 

### Portfolio

Aside form a bunch of personal projects on here, I don't really have a 'portfolio' as such — it's just much harder for developers than designers, however, two examples of commercial work that are still available and not subject to NDA would be [incolchester.co.uk](https://incolchester.co.uk) and [visitclaphamjunction.com](https://visitclaphamjunction.com) — both based on CraftCMS. There's also the [Studio2br](https://2br.com) site — everything else has either been taken down, changed, subject to NDA, or not publicly available. As always, linking to live projects is risky — things can change at the drop of a hat, and suddenly it's no longer the site I once built.

### Personal Endeavours

I recently built the same app using Next, Nuxt, Angular, Svelte and Solid — all but one of which I'd never used before — in less than 10 days.

### Game Dev

I've written a number of JavaScript-based games, some of which are available on the iOS App Store (with thanks to [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com)) — examples include [Knobs](https://github.com/jamesrock/knobs), [HexBlox](https://github.com/jamesrock/hex-blox), [HexSnake](https://github.com/jamesrock/hex-snake), [HexDraw](https://github.com/jamesrock/hex-draw), [Rodoku](https://github.com/jamesrock/rodoku), [Thirteens](https://github.com/jamesrock/thirteens), and perhaps my favorite of the lot, [FrappyBird](https://github.com/jamesrock/frappybird).
