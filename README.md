## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James â€” a Senior Front-End Developer with over 15 years experience under my belt. 

Currently based in Nottingham, I'm ideally looking for remote London-based roles â€” my intention is to be back down that way working on-site 5 days a week before too long.

My full CV is available over at [jamesrock.me](jamesrock.me). 

### Background

I'm across the full front-end spectrum, including UX design, having built and contributed to many wonderful projects over the years, working with well-known brands such as BMW, MINI, GSK, Sky Sports, Heineken, Post Office, Ben & Jerry's and London Fashion Week to name a few.

### Latest Project

I recently built the same app using [Next](https://nextjs.org), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), [Angular](https://angular.dev), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Solid](https://docs.solidjs.com) â€” all but one of which I'd never used before â€” in less than 10 days. 

All five repos can be found here on GitHub:

[github.com/svelte-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/svelte-movies)  
[github.com/nuxt-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nuxt-movies)  
[github.com/next-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nextjs-movies)  
[github.com/solid-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/solid-movies)  
[github.com/angular-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/angular-movies)  

### Older Projects

I'm rather fond of my Flappy Bird remake â€” the classic tap-to-flap game no longer available on the AppStore â€” go check it out over at [frappybird.com](https://frappybird.com). You can find the repo at [github.com/phaser-frappybird](https://github.com/jamesrock/phaser-frappybird).

Besides this I've built several other web-based games, most of which are available on the AppStore (with thanks to Capacitor) â€” examples include [capacitor-rodoku](https://github.com/jamesrock/capacitor-rodoku), a one-thumb form of Sudoku, [capacitor-thirteens](https://github.com/jamesrock/capacitor-thirteens), a unique solitaire-style card game, and [capacitor-hexblox](https://github.com/jamesrock/capacitor-hexblox), a stripped-back version of Tetris.
