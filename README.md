## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James â€” a Senior Front-End Developer. 

Formerly freelance, now perm, Iâ€™m currently open to new opportunities. 

See my CV over at [jamesrock.me](jamesrock.me). 

I recently built the same app using Next, Nuxt, Angular, Svelte, and Solid â€” all but one of which I'd never use before â€” in an effort to demonstrate that picking up frameworks isn't quite the huge deal hiring managers seem to think it is...

[svelte-movies.jamesrock.me](https://svelte-movies.jamesrock.me)  
[nuxt-movies.jamesrock.me](https://nuxt-movies.jamesrock.me)  
[next-movies.jamesrock.me](https://next-movies.jamesrock.me)  
[solid-movies.jamesrock.me](https://solid-movies.jamesrock.me)  
[ngular-movies.jamesrock.me](https://angular-movies.jamesrock.me)  

All five repos can be found here on GitHub...

[github.com/svelte-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/svelte-movies)  
[github.com/nuxt-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nuxt-movies)  
[github.com/nextjs-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/nextjs-movies)  
[github.com/solid-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/solid-movies)  
[github.com/angular-movies](https://github.com/jamesrock/angular-movies)  

Beyond that, in terms of personal projects, I'm rather fond of my Flappy Bird remake â€” the classic tap-to-flap game no longer available on the AppStore â€” go check it out over at [frappybird.com](https://frappybird.com). You can find the repo at [github.com/jamesrock/phaser-frappybird](https://github.com/jamesrock/phaser-frappybird).
